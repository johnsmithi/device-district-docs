DD is a project that allows you to create your own ecosystem on top of any platform, including smartphones. Our motto is "Ecosystema liberabit vos," which means "The ecosystem liberates," implying that our project aims to ensure independence from corporate ecosystems that force you to use a specific set of proprietary products.

We hope that our project will become open source, although we currently do not have the resources for that. In any case, we will always have a free version with extensive functionality.

In this repository, we will publish all necessary links related to our project.
